                <h1>More In Depth Look into Colorless</h1>
                <h2>Colorless is a Turned-Based RPG that incorporates Time Attacks and Timed Defense. Colorless is heavily inspired by the Paper Mario  series and Mario and Luigi RPG Series. Most of the ideas in those games are going to be incorporated into Colorless. Gathering  partners, gaining abilities, fighting enemies, finding secrets, leveling up, meeting wacky characters, doing sidequests, and playing minigames. Color is an important part in Colorless. Color defined by me is your passion, emotions, and imagination. Color is the character's emotions, thinking and personality. Without it, they are an empty shell of nothing. In the demo, you won`t see much of what color means. Most of what chapter one covers is the game mechanics. In the prologue chapter, I will include more important explanations about why being colorless is a terrible thing to happen and how it all works. It will have more story than gameplay. Here is a quote that will begin the prologue chapter: <br><br>“Don`t lose the color in your life. We all have different mixes of  color inside of us. It changes everyday as we grow and think  differently. It is the embodiment of what we are But… sometimes life dulls our colors and we lose ourselves. It can be hard to keep our colors bright but it`s never okay to let them go away. As when you  lose your colors… you lose yourself. Don`t become colorless…”</h2>
                <h1>More In Depth Look into the Developer</h1>
                <h2>   Hi, my name is Adam Baj. I am the solo creator of colorless. I do mostly all the music, all the coding, and all the game design. I get my art from multiple Fiverr artists and have a sound designer. I am 22 years old and graduated from Stetson University in 2023. I got a bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems and a  Minor in Music. I started creating Colorless as my senior project and was fully committed to extending the project into a fully fledged game no matter how long it took. Now, I work part time at a pool  as a lifeguard and work on the game daily no matter how short or  how long. I am also a rock climber and a yoga enjoyer. <br><br>   What got me into video games in the first place? When I was 5 years old, I got a Nintendo DS and played Pokemon Pearl as my first ever video game. That is when my love for video games started. I continued to play more and more video games until this very day. Nintendo was the leading factor into why I got so interested into it. Mario, Zelda, Kirby, Pokemon were all games I enjoyed when I was young and I continue to play them as the newer games come out. But Nintendo is not the only company that stole my heart. Riot Games would be the other company that got me hooked. Although I have a love/hate relationship with League of Legends, I cannot deny that I still love almost all parts of the game. The stories, the characters, the gameplay, the music, the esports, and the continuing factor to share this amazing world that they built. One day I wish to be  a part of it someday. But what about AAA companies?<br><br>   I`ve learned in my many hours of research that AAA companies are not for me and I do not support the main goal of what they want. Money. I don`t want to create games to make a lot of money. The main reason that anyone should make a game is to make something special that others will enjoy. Which is what indie developed games aim to do. No matter how big the player base, no matter how much it makes, Indie games at least know they accomplished the main goal. Creating a game that others enjoy.</h2>
                <h1>Why Can`t I Work on Colorless Full Time</h1>
                <h2>In short, Money. I don`t fully regret going to college but I cant  say it wasn`t a waste of time either. The high price of going to this private institution was an experience I can`t get anywhere else but the heavy weight of loans make me regret my decisions every day.  Also, finding a job in any form in the tech industry has been a  nightmare. I am obviously not just looking for game development jobs but also, IT, Web Development, Software Engineers jobs and alot more. Most of the jobs require experience in the field or many past projects. Which I have but not many. So for now, I work as a  lifeguard at a pool so I can pay my loans. Thankfully, my parents are very understanding of what I am trying to do. They let me live with them. So if you want to help accelerate the process, of getting Colorless out or want to support me so I can work on it more than now, you can do so by again: Playing the demo, sharing the game with your friends, watching the devlogs on the youtube channel, do a one time donation on the donation page, or subscribing to the Ko-Fi for more exclusive content also located on the donation page.</h2>
                <h1>Everything I Use to Make Colorless</h1>
                <h2>The game engine I am using is Unity. If I do create art, I am using Aseprite. Aseprite is an amazing cheap pixel art creation tool. Super powerful and has a lot of tools to make pixel art creation easy. The Music creation software I use is Cubase LE AI elements 12. I use instruments that they provide and also some Kontakt instrument libraries like Ethereal Earth, and Analog Dreams. If I have to make sound effects I simply use Audacity and use tools like Graillon and TimeMachine to add bit crunch effects and Autotune. For most of the art, I use Fiverr artists. I`ve only really had one bad experience with an artist but most of them are easy to work with and have amazing skills. If you would like to know some of the artists, the demo has a credit scene and you can also find the credits for the demo on my youtube channel.</h2>
